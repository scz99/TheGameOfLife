What Algorithm says according to Conway...

Conway chose his rules carefully, after considerable experimentation, to meet these criteria:

      1. There should be no explosive growth.
      2. There should exist small initial patterns with chaotic, unpredictable outcomes.
      3. There should be potential for von Neumann universal constructors.
      4. The rules should be as simple as possible, whilst adhering to the above constraints.
